# geoguesser-lite
## Overview
Inspired by Geoguessr --- without the new jazzy new avatars & a subscription to pay for the Google Maps API, but with all the guesses you need! Geoguesser-lite is a game for map & city lovers or potentially an inspiration for your next holiday destination. 

* 5 rounds of randomised cities, 3 guesses each
* Click anywhere on the map where you think the city is
* Guess within 3000km of the answer to score some points & within 100km to get an instant win
* Country hint available for each round
Guess away!

## Process
### 1. Figma Prototyping
![geoguesser-lite figma](https://github.com/chunxtan/geoguesser-lite/assets/99042026/a2262854-e524-4b42-bbdc-b42db7ac2a0b)
<br>
Simple prototype wireframing on figma to test out interaction and user flow. 

### 2. Finding a list of cities with coordinates

<br>
~43,000 cities and their associated latlng coordinates found on https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities ðŸŒŽ

### 3. Experimenting with different basemaps

<br>
Finding a suitable basemap (without giving away any names!) on https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers

### 4. Leafletjs
https://leafletjs.com/
* Open-source JS library for interactive maps
* Provided map interactions for getting coordinates, rendering pins/polylines & zooming

### 5. Future Development
* Penalty of score with the use of hints
* Option for user to choose continent/country/region to play
* Option to reveal direction to city from current guess
